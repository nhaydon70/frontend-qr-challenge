## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Visual Studio Code

### What I learned

I used basic CSS properties to customize the look.

### Continued development

I am looking to practice and learn CSS. I am a backend developer and CSS is definetly my weakest part of my skills.

### Useful resources

- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com) - I have been taken 100 Days of code class on Udemy. Angela Yu does a great job going over CSS.
